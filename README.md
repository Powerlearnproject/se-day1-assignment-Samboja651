# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
> is the application of technology in designing, developing, testing and maintaining systems. \
> Importance: improve quality of life by technically solving real world problems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
> - 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
>- Requirements gathering for the software.
>- Design - create templates of UI for each feature requirement
>- Implementation - develop/code software
>- Testing - test if the software is bug free and meets user requirements.
>- Deployment - release the product to users
>- Maintenance - regularly run tests/upgrades ensuring code is bug free


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
> Waterfall model is not flexible, you cannot go back to previous phases while Agile model is flexible, you can iterate back and forward.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
> Software Developer is responsible for building or coding the product and maintaining it after deployment. \
> Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the quality of the product by building unit tests, acceptance test, integration and system tests. \
> Project manager oversees the product development. 
> - PM ensures the product meets the user needs, business needs and development uses the most appropriate technologies.
> - PM ensures they build `the right thing` and `the thing right`


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
> IDE - is an editor for writing code, compiling or translating it to a machine language and displays the it's output. Eg. `vscode, pycharm, netbeans` \
> VCS - `Git` keeps track of changes in code and enables code sharing or collaboration through `Github`, `Bitbucket` or `Gitlab`.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
>-  Bug tracking - knowing when a bug occurs, how and what caused it.
> `sln - use unit test or CI/CD tools that report when this bugs occur`. 
>- perfoming software upgrades without affecting user usage. `sln - choose cloud hosting over installed applications`. In cloud user doesn't have to take any action.
>- Financial constraints - `sln - use open source tools and technologies`


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
